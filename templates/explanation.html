        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Our algorithmic trading system uses advanced AI to predict stock movements and execute trades automatically. This page will help you understand how the system works, including when it buys and sells, what the "Fund Mode" is, and what the "Start Trading" button does.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fund Mode</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The "Fund Mode" allows you to choose between trading with a fixed quantity of shares or a fixed amount of funds. If you select "Quantity," the system will trade a fixed number of shares. If you select "Funds," the system will trade using a fixed amount of money.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Start Trading Button</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The "Start Trading" button initiates the automated trading process based on the latest AI recommendations. Once started, the system will automatically buy and sell stocks according to the predictions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Premium Features</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            As a premium user, you gain access to additional features such as managing multiple accounts, advanced analytics, and priority support. These features are designed to enhance your trading experience and provide more control over your investments.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How It Buys and Sells</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The system buys stocks when the AI predicts a favorable upward trend and sells them when the holding period expires or when the AI predicts a downward trend. The holding period is the time the system holds onto a stock before selling it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
